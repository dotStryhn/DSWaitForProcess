# DSWaitForProcess
A small script i originally made for monitoring CCMSetup when installing on remote computers, I just made it generic to look for any process on any computer, this means no more sitting waiting for the feedback from the user to close a program, or a server to finish an installation, you can see it when i happens, without RDP or scripting.
